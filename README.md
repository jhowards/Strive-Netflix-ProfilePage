# Strive-Netflix-ProfilePage
 My Team:
 
 James Sutcliffe<br>

 Pavan Kumar Yalamanchi<br>
 
 
 As a team we were tasked to create the most accurate Netflix clone possible.
 Two pages were required - 
 
 The main Netflix page with a header, cards(movies) selection and a footer.
 The Edit Profile page
 
 I was tasked with creating the Edit Profile page while the others split up the header, cards and footer.
 The reference that was used can be found at:
